# Design Document (50%)
***Instructions***
The following Design Document sections should be completed, regardless of whether you have implemented the feature in your prototype or not. If you have not implemented the feature, your response should reflect any design decisions you would make you were to implement it in a future update to your game. Unimplemented design features should clearly be labelled as **(Unimplemented)**.

Please include screenshots and/or design diagrams/mock-ups to illustrate your point/clarify the discussion. Instructions for how to insert images into the Report.md are provided here: [How to Insert Images in Markdown](#how-to-insert-images-in-markdown)

## Player Experience (15%)
### High Concept (5%)
Create a high concept for your game. A high concept should be include:
- What kind of game is it?
- What is unique?
- What is the player doing and feeling?

**Your High Concept (2-4 sentences)**
  > _Write here_

---

### Experience Goals (8%)
The prototype specifications specified that your game should focus on the primary player experiences of **Challenge** and **Drama** and the secondary player experiences of **Fantasy** and **Sensation**.
Explain how you refined each of these goals to establish a specific design vision for your game? 

Write 1-2 sentences for each. 

- **Challenge:**  
  > _Write here..._

- **Drama:**  
  > _Write here..._

- **Fantasy:**  
  > _Write here..._

- **Sensation:**  
  > _Write here..._

### Satisfaction of Player Needs (2%)
- **Which of the SDT needs (autonomy, competency, and/or relatedness) is your game targeting and how? (1 - 2 sentences)**
  > _Write here..._

---

## Game Mechanics (20%)
**Instructions**
In this section, we are looking at the mechanics of your game prototype.
- Write brief 1-2 sentence responses to each question, except where a longer answer is specifically request.
-	Each question should be responded to. If you did not implement a mechanic in your game prototype, then you can base your response on how you might implement that mechanic in future design plans. Use the **(Unimplemented)** tag to indicate where this is the case.

  > _Write here..._

- **How do obstacles affect player movement and require skill to navigate?**
  > _Write here_

- **How does this movement scheme align with the avatar identity and contribute to the fantasy of the game?**
  > _Write here..._

- **How does this movement scheme map to keyboard / gamepad controls?**
  > _Write here..._

- **How does the control scheme allow for skilful control and contribute to the challenge of the game?**
  > _Write here..._

- **What expectation do you have for player familiarity with the movement and control schemes (e.g. experience with particular game genre conventions)?**
  > _Write here..._

---

### Camera Design (2%)
- **How does the camera move in the game?**

---

## Playtesting (15%)
**Instructions**

# Implementation Document
**Instructions:** 
This **Implementation Document** is where you indicate what you have implemented in your game prototype and where the markers will be able can find it within your Unity Project.

Each feature and the marks for implementing them in your prototype has been listed below. For each feature, you must:
1)	Indicate whether you implemented it in your game prototype or not.
2)	Indicate where the marker can find this feature within the Unity Project (identifying particular game objects and visual scripts).
3)	Provide a screenshot(s) of the implemented feature with a caption.

**NOTE:** The marks indicated below reflect the marks for implementing each feature, not for completing the feature entry. This section of the Report is not worth marks directly, but it will aid in marking your prototype, so your grade could be negatively impacted if you have not completed this section and/or it is not clearly presented.

|---------|-----------| --------------------------|
| Sprites |  |   |
| Tilemaps |  |  |

| Keyboard Controls using an Input Asset |  |   |
| Gamepad Controls using an Input Asset |  |   |
| Trigger Colliders |  |   |
| Physics colliders |  |   |
| Collision events |  |   |
| Prefabs |  |   |
| Prefab - Dynamic Instantiation |  |   |
| Object deactivation or destruction |  |   |
| UI layout |  |   |
| UI updating |  |   |
| Camera - Basic |  |   |
| Camera - Cinemachine |  |   |
| Audio - Looping |  |   |
| Audio - Events |  |   |
| WebGL Build | | NA | 
| **Total Implementation Mark** | 50% |
